# Portfolio

Personal portfolio application built with **Angular**.

This project is focused on clean frontend architecture, performance and maintainability, and is treated as a real application rather than a simple static website.

The project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version **21.0.4**.

## Development

### Local development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:4200/
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

---

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools.

To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives or pipes), run

```bash
ng generate --help
```
---

## Build

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile the application and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory.

By default, the production build optimizes the application for performance and speed.
